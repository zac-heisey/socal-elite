> #### “RISE and RISE again until lambs become lions.” – Robin Hood

If you walk into our clinic this quote may be one of the first things you see. So which one are you, a lamb or a lion? Better yet, you’re probably wondering which one we are? Is our company composed of a flock of lambs or a pride of lions? We hate to disappoint you but we are neither.

## “RISE and RISE again”

Where did the word RISE come from? Was it an inspirational word written on a wall somewhere and we decided to make it our logo? Or is it a way of life? At [RISE Physical Therapy](/) we strive to uphold all the core values of our company that are contained with our name: **Revolution In Self Evolution**. So why do we RISE? We have all had moments in our lives where we have had to make the decision to lay down or get back up. From losing a beloved family member, a personal tragedy, losing a job, or a devastating injury, we have all had to fall in order to RISE. We believe that when you fall you shouldn’t jump back up immediately and pretend to be healed. “It is the false shame of fools to try to conceal wounds that have no healed,” said Horace. Take a moment. Let it settle in. Embrace the hurt. Appreciate the fear that comes with falling because when you RISE again you will appreciate the process that much more. We believe in the journey of rising more than we believe in the end result.

## “Until Lambs Become Lions.”

So are we lambs? We are not scared, lonely, and timid lambs but rather keen, social, playful, and instinctive lambs. So are we lions? We are not ferocious, dogmatic, and savage lions but rather strong, pack oriented, driven, graceful, cerebral lions. We are not one or the other. We are evolutions of both.

## "RISE and RISE again..."

We are blessed to have traveled this journey with our family, friends, and patients. We look forward to helping each person that walks through our doors through their self-evolution of becoming their own lambs, lions, or both. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for allowing us to be apart of your lives. And we look forward to watching you RISE.
