We are proud to announce our partnership with the Solana Beach Boys and Girls Club and the Rancho San Dieguito Swim Club! RISE Physical Therapy will be providing resources for all swimmers and families related to swimming and other activities. In order the grow this relationship, just like building an elite swimmer, we must start with our foundation.

In the coming posts we will talk about gravity, positioning, training, flexibility, strengthening, and injuries related to swimming. In order to lay the foundation for these discussions, we encourage you to think about one thing: does the way I'm training look like the activity I am training for?

If you're a professional basketball player, do you live in a world where you're lying on your back? No.

If you're a baseball pitcher, do you live in a world where you're hunched over doing crunches? No.

If you're a swimmer, do you live in a world where your shoulder moves in isolation? No.

If the answer to these questions is repeatedly "no", then why do we make the mistake of training this way? It goes back to laying a proper foundation. Moving, training, and competing involve a series of complex movements that involve multiple joints moving in multiple planes on motion. In the coming weeks we will talk about these movements and how we can train them for swimming. In the meantime, we invite you to start thinking critically about your training and activities and ask yourself: does the way I am training look like the activity I am training for?

We look forward to building a strong foundation moving forward. If you have any questions or would like to discuss anything you read please contact us at: **rise@risephysicaltherapy.com**
