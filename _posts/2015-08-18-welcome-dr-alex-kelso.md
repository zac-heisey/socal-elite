Unlike most medical practices, RISE Physical Therapy is based on our community. For that reason, we have chosen never to hire another provider for the sole reason of growth for the practice. We have made a promise to our patients and the community to only grow when we have individuals who have demonstrated their ability to grow within their community. One of our core foundational principles involves individualized patient care and community support. RISE continues to be an innovator in patient-centered, [one-on-one physical therapy](/). It is for that reason that we are proud to announce to hiring of Dr. Alex Kelso, DPT, CAFS.

Dr. Kelso recently completed his Doctor of Physical Therapy degree from the University of Southern California. Most of our past and current patients may recognize Alex from his time spent while doing his clinical internships at RISE.

Dr. Kelso can be seen working with organizations within North County and San Diego while donating his time and resources to give back to his community. In the coming weeks we will highlight several of the community partners that Dr. Kelso has become involved with.

Please join us in welcoming Dr. Alex Kelso to the [RISE Physical Therapy team](/#team)!
