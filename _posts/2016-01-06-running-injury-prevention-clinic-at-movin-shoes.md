Over the last few years, [RISE Physical Therapy](/) has been proud to grow our relationship with Movin Shoes in Encinitas, CA. As a local footwear and apparel provider in North County and across San Diego county, Movin Shoes has been a staple in the community for many years. Their quality is matched only by their passion for running and movement. Along the way, RISE Physical Therapy and Movin Shoes bonded over a love for healthy, happy runners. We are proud to announce that on Thursday, January 14th at 7 PM we will be at the Encinitas store hosting a Running Injury Prevention Clinic. During this clinic we will review:

- Proper warm-up techniques

- Common running injuries and prevention strategies

- Common misconceptions related to running and training

If you, or anyone you know, is interested in stopping by to learn more about running, injury prevention, Movin Shoes, or RISE Physical Therapy, stop by at the Encinitas Movin Shoes on Thursday, January 14th at 7 PM.

We look forward to helping you RISE!
