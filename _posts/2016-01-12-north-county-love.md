Although our love for therapy and wellness is growing across San Diego County, at RISE Physical Therapy we always remain true to our roots. Our original clinic was established in Solana Beach on March 17th, 2014 and our roots have continued to spread across North County. In addition to our original location in Solana Beach, we have been extremely fortunate to grow our presence in North County through our [physical therapy clinic in Carlsbad](http://localhost:4000/locations/carlsbad-physical-therapy).

The proximity of our two original locations to many cities and areas in and around North County San Diego have allowed us to provide the highest quality care to our patients. From Oceanside, Escondido, San Marcos, and Carlsbad to Encinitas, Olivenhain, Leucadia, Cardiff By The Sea, Rancho Santa Fe, Del Mar, Carmel Valley, and Solana Beach we have served the community with our unique, individualized approach to physical therapy.

In addition to our passion for giving back to the North County San Diego area, [RISE Physical Therapy](/) is proud to service South San Diego via our newest location in [Liberty Station in Point Loma, San Diego](http://localhost:4000/locations/point-loma-physical-therapy). Stay tuned for more news and updates regarding our newest clinic. We look forward to providing 1-on-1 physical therapy to patients throughout San Diego county!
