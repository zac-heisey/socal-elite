description: Many parents are not sure what to do when their child is diagnosed with
  Torticollis or its associated conditions. Regardless of the patient’s age, physical
  therapy is the primary treatment for all forms of torticollis. Torticollis can present
  in many ways, and at RISE we create an individualized Physical Therapy treatment
  program to help address each patient’s specific impairments. Parents play a big
  part in addressing Torticollis, so RISE will teach you to treat you child with thorough
  education and customized videos for each patient. This differs from many “cookie-cutter”
  protocols that may not address the underlying cause, leading to issues that can
  reoccur later in life and cause permanent disabilities (such as delayed milestones
  and gross motor development, Plagiocephaly, strength and muscular imbalances, hip
  dysplasia, and scoliosis). To learn more about how our treatments can help your
  child, contact our Point Loma location!
