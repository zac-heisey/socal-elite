description: We offer immediate treatment through the critical acute stage of injuries
  to facilitate a faster return to your normal life. An acute injury can range from
  an ankle sprain to whiplash from a motor vehicle accident. We use a wide variety
  of biomechanical, functionally based tools and exercises to help you get back to
  your life after surgery. Below are a list of a few post-operative surgeries we can
  assist you with foot/ankle, knee, hip, spine (lumbar, thoracic, or cervical), shoulder,
  and elbow/wrist/hand.
