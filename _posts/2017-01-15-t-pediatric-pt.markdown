description: Working with children and young adults is one of the many wonderful privileges
  we have as active members of the North County San Diego community. Not only do our
  therapists and staff create a fun and welcoming environment for our younger patients,
  but most of us are big kids ourselves! Our therapists have extensive experience
  working with all levels of pediatric injuries including ankle/knee sprains, growth
  plate fractures, low back pain, shoulder instability, and tendinitis.
