description: We offer a total body biomechanical assessment to all of our patients.
  We will evaluate you from youâ€™re your toes to your nose and regardless of diagnosis
  or injury, we seek to not only find the source of the pain or injury, but also the
  cause. This unique approach was developed by Gary Gray and the Gray Institute and
  allows our therapists to serve our patients not only to help them in the short term,
  but to guide them with principles, strategies, and techniques that will benefit
  their long term health. We strive to assess, treat, and train the body in the most
  authentic and functional positions to set the body up for success.
