description: Not every patient at RISE is being treated for a musculoskeletal disorder.
  Many of our patients have had a disruption to other systems in the body and need
  help returning to the activities they enjoy. We help these individuals function
  optimally by challenging their bodies in safe, fun, and functional tasks. Some common
  non-orthopedic disorders that can be benefitted by physical therapy and neurological
  rehabilitation are Parkinson’s disease, CVA or “stroke”, pinched nerves, Multiple
  Sclerosis, headaches or migraines, and vertigo or dizziness. Learn more about RISE
  Physical Therapy, browse our staff profiles, or contact us today!
