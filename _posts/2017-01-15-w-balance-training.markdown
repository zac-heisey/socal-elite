description: At RISE, we build on Gary Grayâ€™s powerful quote to help patients achieve
  improved balance throughout their journey of self evolution. Balance training benefits
  patients by decreasing fall risk, developing confidence in daily activities, increasing
  energy efficiency, reducing likelihood of injury, eliminating consequences of compensations,
  and increasing speed, strength, and power during athletic activities.
