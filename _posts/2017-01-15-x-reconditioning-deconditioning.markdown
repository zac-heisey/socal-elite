description: Deconditioning is the loss of function following a period of inactivity
  or decreased demand on a specific body system. At RISE Physical Therapy, we help
  individuals that have experienced a wide variety of events that may cause deconditioning.
  Our unique approach to reconditioning treatment involves fun, functional exercises
  to help patients enjoy the reconditioning process. We utilize gravity depending
  body weight exercises, along with simple home program based around easy-to-follow
  pictures and videos.
