description: At RISE, we believe that preventing an injury may be just as, if not
  more important than, rehabilitating an injury. Injury prevention can lead to improved
  energy levels, elevated mood, improved ability to engage in daily activities, improved
  athletic performance, and the overall increased quality of life. As a service to
  the community we offer Free Injury Assessments in Solana Beach. Please contact us
  to schedule a free injury assessment, or stop by our office!
