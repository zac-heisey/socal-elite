bio: Dawn’s passion for Occupational Therapy stems from the need to help her mom’s arthritic hands from cutting hair for 20 years and counting! Once Dawn found that there was so much more to Occupational therapy than just meets the hand, she dived into pediatrics/ geriatrics and loved every moment of it. On her free time, when she’s not lifting wrists and fingers, she enjoys lifting weights, lifting her nephew, lifting pages in books, and lifting lids when she’s cooking.
