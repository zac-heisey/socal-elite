bio: Duston became interested in fitness and wellness from playing sports while growing
  up. His love for basketball and helping others drove him towards physical therapy.
  Seeing his teammates rehabbing their injuries to return to playing sports helped
  to grow his interest in physical therapy. He appreciates how physical therapy allows
  him to learn about his patients and help them return to the activities they love.
  Outside of the clinic, he enjoys playing basketball, lifting weights, hiking, going
  to the beach and spending time with his dogs Hapa and Bella.
