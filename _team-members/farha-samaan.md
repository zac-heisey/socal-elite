bio: Farha's interest in physical therapy was due to wanting to take a patient-centered
  approach and help people reduce the need of taking pain medication or overcome injuries
  in order to get back to doing what they love. Farha enjoys how physical therapy
  allows her to get to know patients and assist with reaching their goals. She and
  her husband, George, enjoy traveling, going to the beach, and being foodies.
