bio: Jeffâ€™s passion for physical therapy stemmed from a shoulder injury while wrestling
  in high school. He was inspired by the personable care he received from his physical
  therapist and wanted to serve others in the same way, helping them do what they
  love again to their fullest potential. He enjoys learning about the human body to
  optimize performance and has high aspirations of one day dunking. In his free time,
  he loves staying active through volleyball, snowboarding, surfing, powerlifting,
  and hiking.
