bio: Jessicaâ€™s passion for helping others with health and wellness began early on
  in her life while completing caregiver duties part-time during high school. As she
  transitioned into college, she became fascinated with the human body, movement,
  and improving individual wellness. She appreciates the impact on the quality of
  life that physical therapy has to offer and enjoys taking part in assisting patients
  to reach their personal goals. Outside of the clinic, Jessica loves hiking, biking,
  cooking, exploring the outdoors, and spending quality time with friends and family.
