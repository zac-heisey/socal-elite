bio: Martin's interest for physical therapy was sparked by overcoming his own injuries
  as a competitive basketball player and long-distance runner while growing up in
  Texas. He enjoys taking the journey with his patients through the process of rehabilitation,
  teaching them about their own bodies, and watching them leave pain-free with a smile.
  Outside of the clinic, he enjoys playing pick-up basketball at the local gym, running
  along the beach, trying new foods, and exploring his new home in San Diego.
