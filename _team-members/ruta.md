bio: Rutaâ€™s interest in physical therapy started at a young age, seeing her mom help
  many around her. She followed her footsteps into a fulfilling career, earning her
  Doctorate in Physical Therapy, from Columbia University in 2015. She is trained
  in classical Indian dance forms, loves to play sports, do yoga, go on hikes/walks
  with family and friends; she believes that movement has strength, it serves our
  mind and brings happiness to our heart. She provides care to improve quality of
  life and overall wellness, and loves treating all age groups. When not in the clinic,
  you'll probably catch her in the sun, out in nature, or thinking about her next
  meal!
